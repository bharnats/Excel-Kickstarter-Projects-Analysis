# Excel-Kickstarter-Projects-Analysis
        Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. for this Analysis,I've organized and analyzed a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

-Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `outcome` column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or is currently "live".
-'Percent funded` that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made towards reaching its initial goal.
-'Percent funded` column using a three-color scale, starting at 0 with a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and then moving towards blue at 200.
-'Average donation` that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
-Created  a pivot table and line charts that will analyze the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or are currently "live" per Category, Sub Category, launch date and Goal amount.
-Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by `country` based on the table created.
