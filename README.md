# Excel-Kickstarter-Projects-Analysis

## Abstract

Kickstarter is one of the most popular crowdfunding platform on the internet. The aim of this project is to predict the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign at launch time.

## Background
Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this Analysis, I've organized and analyzed a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

#### The conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns, given the provided data are:
Tricks to make through the funding process with positive outcome in Kickstarter;
From the graphs and charts, the success rate of the projects is affected by Category, Subcategory, Launch dates and Goal range of the campaigns. The following are the Category and subcategory that give in high success rates for the projects.
•	Classical music, Electronic, Indie Rock, metal, pop and rock music under the Music Category.
•	Documentary, shorts and television from Film/Video Category.
•	Plays from Theater category.
The projects launched during the month of May have more chances of succeeding to raise funds. Avoid launching the projects in December (may be due to holiday season). They have the highest failure and cancellation rates. Small scale projects with Goal amount less than $1000 have higher success rate as compared to large scale projects.

## limitations of this dataset
Person conducting the research of the data to answer the hypothesis or the research question was not involved in Data collection. This is referred to as secondary analysis of existing data. Also, the data collected was not intended to answer the hypothesis. Another major limitation of the analysis of existing data is that the researchers who are analyzing the data are not usually the same individuals as those involved in the data collection process. Therefore, they are probably unaware of study-specific nuances or glitches in the data collection process that may be important to the interpretation of specific variables in the dataset.
Researchers or the Data analyst must have a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the dataset. This involves obtaining detailed descriptions of the population under study, sampling scheme and strategy, time frame of data collection, assessment tools, response levels, and quality control measures.
